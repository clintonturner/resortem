# resortem
`resortem.ps1` (re-sort 'em) is a simple Powershell script that sorts files in alphabetical order by moving them out of a folder and back in. 
It's useful for FAT32 USB drives containing MP3s to play in car stereos.

# Usage
Copy `resortem.ps1` to your USB drive and run it, providing the path to be sorted, eg:

`./resortem.ps1 .`

`./resortem.ps1 './Some Folder Name/'`

# WARNING
Use at your own risk! This script moves files around. I wrote it for my own personal use.
